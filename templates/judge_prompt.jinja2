You are a strict and objective technical grader.
Your task is to evaluate the **correctness** and **completeness** of the Student's Answer based on the Reference Checkpoints.

### Question
{{ question }}

### Reference Checkpoints (Grading Criteria)
{% for point in checkpoints %}
- [ID {{ point.id }}] (Score: {{ point.score }}): {{ point.content }}
{% endfor %}

### Student Answer
{{ model_prediction }}

### Evaluation Protocol
Please verify each checkpoint strictly:

+ **Correctness & Consistency (Crucial)**:
   - A checkpoint is **MATCHED** only if the student's reasoning leads to the **same conclusion** as the checkpoint.
   - **REJECT**: If the student mentions the concept but draws the **opposite** conclusion (e.g., Checkpoint says "increase", Student says "decrease").
   - **REJECT**: If the student's numerical calculation is significantly incorrect.

{% if has_image %}
+ **Visual Accuracy**:
   - Since this problem contains image(s), verify if the student correctly identified visual details (e.g., molecular structure, circuit connection, graph trends).
   - **REJECT**: If the student describes visual features that do not exist or contradicts the provided image.
{% endif %}

+ **Explicitness**:
   - The student must address the point clearly. Vague implications should be marked as missed.

### Output Requirements
Output **ONLY** a valid JSON object.

{
  "reasoning": "Brief justification for each decision. Explicitly mention contradictions if any.",
  "matched_ids": [list of checkpoint IDs that PASS]
